# Profit & Loss Analysis
Obtain the financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement) of the partner companies for each year under consideration. Calculate EBITDA for each partner company by summing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for 2016 - 2018. This metric provides a clear view of operating performance. Calculate the year-over-year growth rate for EBITDA. Positive growth may indicate a healthy business, while declining EBITDA may warrant further investigation.
